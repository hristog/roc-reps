# Roc Enhancement Proposal (REP)

The goal of REPs is to standardize and provide high-quality documentation for the Roc programming language. This repository tracks past and ongoing proposals in the form of REPs. [REP-1](REPs/rep-1.md) governs how REPs are published.

The status page (_TBD_) tracks and lists REPs, which can be divided into the following categories:
- **Standard Track REPs** describe with changes that affect the Roc compiler, standard library, API design and platforms.
- **Meta REPs** describe new processes or updates to existing processes, associated with the Roc ecosystem and community.
- **Informational REPs** describe Roc design issues or provide general guidelines or information to the Roc community.

:warning: Before you write a REP, ideas *must* be thoroughly discussed on Roc's ZulipChat [server](https://roc.zulipchat.com/). Once consensus is reached, thoroughly read and review [REP-1](REPs/rep-1.md), which describes the REP process.

## Preferred Citation Format

The canonical URL for an REP that has achieved draft status at any point is _TBD_. For example, the canonical URL for REP-1 is [REPs/rep-1.md](REPs/rep-1.md).
