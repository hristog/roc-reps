## What is a Roc Enhancement Proposal (REP)?

A REP is a design document which serves to provide information to the Roc community, and is substantiated with a technical specification and rationale. Its purpose is driving technical discussion around a proposed feature or a process change, and at the same time capturing the associated design decisions.

## REP Types
There are three types of REPs:
- **Standard Track REPs** describe with changes that affect the Roc compiler, standard library, API design and platforms.
- **Meta REPs** describe new processes or updates to existing processes, associated with the Roc ecosystem and community.
- **Informational REPs** describe Roc design issues or provide general guidelines or information to the Roc community.

## Guidelines

Ideally, a single REP should contain a single key proposal or idea. The scope of a REP entails the design document, accompanying implementation (where applicable) and associated updates to Roc's formal specification (where applicable).
